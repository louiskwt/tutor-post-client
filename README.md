# Tutor Post Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

This web app is created for tutor to find new students and market themselves

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Learn More

At the stage, this application is just a prototype, and it's not ready for production due to issues with the backend. 

In the future, I plan to work on the backend and have everything deployed to serve real users.
